Datamonster v.1.1
============

Datamonster is a JavaScript addon for [DripStat](https://dripstat.com/game/).

This is not for cheating, it simply displays information you can find out on your own (if you wanted to do all the calculations) and cleans-up the UI a bit (if enabled). Everything in Datamonster is an option that is disabled by default so you can pick and choose what you'd like see/change.

How to Use/Install
-----

```
javascript:(function(){
	$.getScript('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlyingKumquat/Datamonster/master/datamonster.js')
}());
```
